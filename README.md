## ProcAID

ProcAID stands for "Process Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection." The solution is made of two stages: 

1. Stage One: Unsupervised link prediction on a process creation log focused graph 
2. Stage Two: Inverse leadership and inverse density analysis  

For convenience and use-case purposes, this repository contains only Stage one of ProcAID.
